What This Package Can Do

  At this point numeral system conversion between Western (Arabic, base 10)
  and Ethiopic.  Ethiopic numerals sequences must be in UTF-8.   The Ilf-Radix
  algorithm is applied in representing the Ethiopic sequences.

  Presently the package works best with Perl 5.8.0, it has not been
  satisfactorily tested on older versions.
