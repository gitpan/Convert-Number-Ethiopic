=head1 NAME

Convert::Number::Ethiopic - Convert Between Western and Ethiopic Numeral Systems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #
 #  instantiate with a Western or Ethiopic number (in UTF-8)
 #
 my $n = new Convert::Number::Ethiopic( 12345 );
 my $etNumber = $n->convert;

 $n->number ( 54321 );    # reset number handle
 print $n->convert, "\n";

 print "2002 => ", $n->convert ( 2002 ), "\n";  # convert new number


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implementation of the Ilf-Radix numeral conversion algorithm entirely
in Perl.  Use to convert between Western and Ethiopic numeral systems.
